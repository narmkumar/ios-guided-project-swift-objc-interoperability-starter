@objc
class Contact: NSObject {
    @objc var name: String
    @objc var relationship: String?
    @objc init(name: String, relationship: String?) {
        self.name = name
        self.relationship = relationship
    }
}

// 1. Use Swift Classes
// 2. Subclass NSObject
// 3. Mark your properties / methods with @objc (@objcmembers)
